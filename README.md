+ This app will allow clients to connect their twitter accounts, fetch their tweets and reply to them within the application.
+ Problem: Imagine a company like Amazon - they get mentioned on twitter thousands of times each day. It’s humanly impossible to reply to each tweet by logging in to twitter. 
+ Solution: They’ll use your Twitter helpdesk to connect their Twitter handle and fetch all tweets. Then they will invite their internal team members on the Helpdesk app so they can share the workload. And team members can reply to the tweets from the helpdesk.
